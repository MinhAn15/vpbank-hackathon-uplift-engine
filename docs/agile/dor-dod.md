# Definition of Ready (DoR) & Definition of Done (DoD)

## DoR — A story is READY when
- Business outcome and Acceptance Criteria (AC) are measurable (e.g., Profit@K+X%)
- Data availability confirmed or plan to create (A/B design, sampling, labels)
- Compliance constraints identified (PII, retention, IAM)
- Dependencies and risks listed; mock/data contract updated if needed
- Size estimated; story can be completed within a sprint

## DoD — A story is DONE when
- Code merged with passing unit/integration tests; coverage meets team baseline
- IaC validated and applied (with approval when required)
- Monitoring/alerts updated; dashboards reflect new metrics
- Runbook/readme updated; rollback plan verified (where applicable)
- Demo executed; results recorded (Model Card update for ML stories)
- No high/critical security findings outstanding
