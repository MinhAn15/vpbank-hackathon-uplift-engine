# Notebooks

Suggested notebooks (to add):
- 1.0-data-simulation.ipynb — generate sample_data.csv with realistic patterns
- 2.0-uplift-model-training.ipynb — train uplift models (UpliftRF, DR-Learner, CatBoost Uplift)

Tips:
- Keep cells small and reproducible; pin a requirements file locally if needed.
- Use time-aware splits and stratify by treatment.
